**E-Bass**  
Author: jaxter184  
Device: Instrument Layer  
Description: Uses lots and lots of amps to turn a regular saw/pulse bass into an emulation of an electric bass. I don't actually play electric bass at all, so if this sounds wrong, then sorry. At the very least, it's a cool, subtle bass with a lot of flexibility. It also plays very very well with pitch automation, so I recommend trying that out. Polyphony, not so much.
